**Section:** CMSC 23 UV5L\
**Application Description:** This program alters the sample code in the handout to add a checkout feature.\
**Things you did in the code:** In addition to the sample code, I created a separate dart file called checkout.dart in the screen folder. I also added some code in main.dart and MyCart.dart to create a checkout route.\
**Challenges when developing the application:** Because this is an asynchronous exercise, I had to study the handout myself and understand the sample code. Luckily, the exercise is related to the examples, so I was able to finish this exercise quickly.\
**Note:** I only added documentations to the lines of code I made myself, as the other files were given in the handout already.
